# Online Security & Search Tools

## Advanced Search (Google Dorking)

Use operators in search engines to narrow down results.

| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filetype:` | Restricts results to a specific file type (e.g., `filetype:pdf`). |
| `-` | Excludes a term from the search (e.g., `jaguar -car`). |
| `site:` | Limits the search to a specific website (e.g., `site:github.com`). |
| `""` | Searches for an exact phrase (e.g., `"exact phrase to search"`). |

## Specialized Search Engines

- **Shodan**: [shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)
  - A search engine for Internet-connected devices like servers, networking equipment, and IoT.
- **Censys**: [search.censys.io](https://search.censys.io/)
  - Focuses on internet-connected hosts, websites, and certificates. Used for asset discovery and auditing open ports.

## Security & Data Breach Services

- **VirusTotal**: [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
  - Scans files, URLs, and hashes against multiple antivirus engines to detect malware.
- **Have I Been Pwned**: [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
  - Checks if an email address has been compromised in a known data breach.

## Vulnerability & Exploit Databases

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/)
  - A standardized list of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.
  - Often searched via the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- **Exploit Database**: [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  - A repository of exploit code, often linked to CVEs.
- **GitHub**: [github.com](https://github.com/)
  - A primary source for finding Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for CVEs and other security research.
