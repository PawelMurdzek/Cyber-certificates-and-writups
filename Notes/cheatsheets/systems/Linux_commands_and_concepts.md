## Shell Operators and Job Control

| Operator/Shortcut | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `&` | Runs a command in the background. |
| `&&` | "AND" operator. Runs the second command only if the first one succeeds. |
| `>` | Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file. |
| `>>` | Appends the output of a command to a file. |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Suspends the current foreground process. |
| `fg` | Resumes a suspended process and brings it to the foreground. |

## Automation with Cron

`cron` is a time-based job scheduler. User tasks are defined in a `crontab` file.

A `crontab` entry has 6 fields:
`MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD`
- **MIN**: Minute (0-59)
- **HOUR**: Hour (0-23)
- **DOM**: Day of Month (1-31)
- **MON**: Month (1-12)
- **DOW**: Day of Week (0-7, Sun=0 or 7)
- **CMD**: The command to be executed.

An asterisk (`*`) in a field means "every".

**Example**: Run a backup script every 12 hours.
0 */12 * * * cp -R /home/user/Documents /var/backups/

**Special String**: `@reboot` runs a command once at startup.

## Package Management (APT)

Managing software from third-party repositories typically involves three steps:

1.  **Trust the GPG Key**: Download the distributor's GPG key to verify the software's authenticity.
    ```bash
    wget -qO - [https://example.com/key.gpg](https://example.com/key.gpg) | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
2.  **Add the Repository**: Add the software repository to your system's sources list, usually in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
    ```bash
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] [https://example.com/](https://example.com/) stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/example.list
    ```
3.  **Update and Install**: Update your package list and install the software.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install software-name
    ```

To remove the software and repository, use `apt remove` and delete the repository file from `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
`
